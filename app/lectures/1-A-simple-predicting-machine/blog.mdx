# Simple Predicting machine

In this Episode of BYONN (Build Your Own Neural Network) we will be building a simple
predicting modal which is responsible for predicting the a value and understanding how
a Neural Network are written.

So what are we waiting for let's get started Padawan.

If you think about it how easy for you to look at a simple conversion like below and 
get predict a value.

But for a computer it is not as simple as it seems like , a computer can not just look
at something an predict it's value like that. 

# The Truth

In this case instead of using the formula we are going to look at the some of the sample values of KM and miles
and from this try to deduce a pattern.

|  | KilloMeter | Miles |
|-------|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0 |     0
| 1   | 1 | 0.62
| 2 | 10 | 6.21371
| 3 | 100 | 62.13
| 4 | 200 | 124.274


if you see the above table you can see this is actually linear pattern. Meaning if we increase the value of 
Km, miles also increase with some same constant.

This can be easily be converted into a graph of y = cx where c is a constant. This graph will look something like 
below.



# Practical Example

So let's see what it will take to a computer to predict a value of a constant c so that we constant can
build a simple predicting machine which can predict the value of miles give the killometer.
